# Welcome to Axehand
Axehand is a custom droplet for automamating the removal of commercial breaks from LoadingReadyLive videos. 

# Usage
Drag a single mp4 file and it's corresponding text file pair onto the Axehand icon. Let it do its magic. If it doesn't work, there's probably something wrong with either of the files and it will have to be processed manually.

# Requirements
- ffmpeg â€“ used for actually processing the files
- Paul's crazy server system

# Upcoming Features
- Multiple file pair drop compatability
- Helpful error reporting

# Support
